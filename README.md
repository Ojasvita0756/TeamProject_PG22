## **Description:**<br>
The Cosmetic Survey Form project aimed to create a simple and interactive platform to learn about what people liked in cosmetics products. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it easy for people to tell us their thoughts about makeup and skincare products. Our website is compact, easy to use, and interactive. By making it user-friendly, we could gather lots of valuable feedback. This helped companies make better products and marketing plans. The project also focused on creating a seamless experience for users, ensuring that navigating through the survey form was effortless. With clear instructions and visually appealing design elements, participants found it convenient to share their opinions on various cosmetic items. Moreover, by incorporating interactive features, such as dropdown menus and radio buttons, we enhanced user engagement, making the survey process enjoyable. This collaborative effort between users and brands fostered a sense of community within the cosmetics industry, ultimately leading to the development of products that better met the diverse needs and preferences of consumers. Through our dedication to simplicity and interactivity, we contributed to a more inclusive and customer-centric approach to cosmetic innovation.
